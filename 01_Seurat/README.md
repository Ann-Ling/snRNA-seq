Tips
1. `02merge_RDS.R`: you should prepare a file named `merge_rds_list.txt`, which contains the file paths of all `.RDS` objects generated by `01RDS.R`.
2. `03cluster_tree.R`: a file named `resolution.txt` should be created, listing the resolution parameters to be tested (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1.2). These values will be used for clustree analysis.
3. `04DEG_find.R`: marker genes are identified using the `FindAllMarkers` function. Significantly overexpressed genes are defined based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with P < 0.01 and logâ‚‚ fold change > 0.1.
4. `05cluster_marker.R`: marker genes should be defined in advance according to your specific dataset, and the code should be modified accordingly. This script is also used to visualize marker genes of EC and EE subtypes.

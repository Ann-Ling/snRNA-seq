# Introduction
To elucidate how Relish influences transcriptional programs in ISC/EBs, we constructed a SCENIC database for A. mellifera and predicted GRN based on coexpression and motif enrichment. The key steps include:
1. Creating cisTarget databases
2. Formatting input
3. SCENIC
4. Visualization

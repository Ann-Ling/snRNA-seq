# Description

---

To investigate the relationship between gut microbiota and intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation, we analyzed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from the midgut, ileum, and rectum of *Apis mellifera*. The following scripts were primarily used in our analysis, including:
1. Single nuclei RNA data integration and clustering.
2. Cross-species cell type similarity analysis
3. Statistics for cell type frequency
4. Differential gene-expression between groups
5. SCENIC analysis
6. Pseudotime analysis

**Tips**: If you want to use our scripts for analysis (especially SCENIC analysis), please configure the environment and modify some parameters according to your own data and environment.

# Introduction
This folder contains scripts for evaluating transcriptional similarities between cell clusters across species using MetaNeighbor. The analysis computes AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic) scores to identify transcriptionally similar clusters between species. The key steps include:
1. Homology comparison
2. Data preprocessing
3. Pseudo-cell generation
4. Cross-species correlation analysis
5. Visualization

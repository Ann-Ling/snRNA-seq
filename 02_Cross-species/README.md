# Introduction
This folder provides scripts for assessing the transcriptional similarity of cell clusters across species using MetaNeighbor. The analysis calculates AUROC scores to identify highly similar clusters between species. The key steps include:
1. Homology comparison
2. Data preprocessing
3. Pseudo-cell generation
4. Cross-species correlation analysis
5. Visualization

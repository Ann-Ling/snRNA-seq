Extract the first two columns, which correspond to the proteins, as well as the last two columns, which contain the e-values and scores, from the file generated by the homology comparison between the two species.
```python
import pandas as pd # 读取txt文件 
df = pd.read_csv("/home/liuhuiling/gene_protein/Bter_Dros/Dros_Bter_protein.txt", delimiter="\t", header=None) # 抽取前两列和后两列 
df_extracted = df.iloc[:, :2].copy() 
df_extracted[2] = df.iloc[:, -2] 
df_extracted[3] = df.iloc[:, -1] # 添加列名 
df_extracted.columns = ["Dros", "Bter", "E value", "score"] # 将结果保存为新的csv件 
df_extracted.to_csv("/home/liuhuiling/gene_protein/Bter_Dros/AM_Dros protein comparison.csv", index=False)
```
